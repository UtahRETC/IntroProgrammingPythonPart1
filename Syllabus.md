## Overview

This is an introduction to computer programming with Python. No previous experience with programming is expected, you simply need access to a computer and to know the basics of how to use it. By the end of this class you will be able to write basic Python programs.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be assigned every week. Assignments should be submitted via Canvas. The assignment's due date and requirements will be detailed in Canvas as well.

## In class exercises

Most class periods will involve in class exercises that you are expected to participate in and will be graded on.

## Grade requirements

A minimum of 70% is required to pass this class. There are no tests or quizzes, grades are 100% based on homework assignments and in class exercises.

## Outline *

### Unit 1: Class Introduction

Students will be introduced to the class, the tools we'll use, and to each
other. We'll go over what is required in order to succeed. We'll also make sure
everyone has Python and a text editor installed. Finally, we'll introduce
students to the basics of computers, programs, and programming.

### Unit 2: Variables, values, and user IO

We're now ready to start coding, so we'll begin by introducing the basic
components of programming: variables, values and operators. We'll also learn
how to write to the screen and read user input.

### Unit 3: Conditionals

We'll be learning about conditionals which will allow us to write programs that
perform different actions depending on a set of conditions that you specify.
We'll take this as a chance to review boolean operations.

### Unit 4: Lists and loops

Introduction to lists and loops. With this complexity comes new creative ways
in which we can solve problems with programming.

### Unit 5: Functions

In this unit we'll cover functions. Functions allow us to reuse our code and
execute it whenever needed.

### Unit 6: Dictionaries

Compare dictionaries to lists as a data structure for storing data. Compare
uses and benefits of a dictionary vs. a list. When would someone reach for a
dictionary as opposed to a list?
