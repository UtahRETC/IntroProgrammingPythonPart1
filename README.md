# Introduction to Programming with Python, part 1

## Requirements

- [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli#install)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)


## Outline

### Unit 1: Class Introduction

Students will be introduced to the class, the tools we'll use, and to each
other. We'll go over what is required in order to succeed. We'll also make sure
everyone has Python and a text editor installed. Finally, we'll introduce
students to the basics of computers, programs, and programming.

### Unit 2: Variables, values, and user IO

We're now ready to start coding, so we'll begin by introducing the basic
components of programming: variables, values and operators. We'll also learn
how to write to the screen and read user input.

### Unit 3: Conditionals

We'll be learning about conditionals which will allow us to write programs that
perform different actions depending on a set of conditions that you specify.
We'll take this as a chance to review boolean operations.

### Unit 4: Lists and loops

Introduction to lists and loops. With this complexity comes new creative ways
in which we can solve problems with programming.

### Unit 5: Functions

In this unit we'll cover functions. Functions allow us to reuse our code and
execute it whenever needed.

### Unit 6: Dictionaries

Compare dictionaries to lists as a data structure for storing data. Compare
uses and benefits of a dictionary vs. a list. When would someone reach for a
dictionary as opposed to a list?

### Unit 99: Next steps

What should I do to continue improving my programming skills?
