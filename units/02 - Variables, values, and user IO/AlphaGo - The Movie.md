Watch the documentary [AlphaGo - The Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y).

AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). Unlike Chess, which has had computer programs that are able to [beat master Chess players for decades](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue), Go was considered to be too complex for a computer program to play at the master level. That is until the team at DeepMind created a program that was able to compete with and even beat master Go players. This documentary follows the team that worked on AlphaGo and their journey to create a program that many thought impossible.

When you're done watching the documentary, submit this assignment and tell me something that you learned from this documentary or thought was interesting.
