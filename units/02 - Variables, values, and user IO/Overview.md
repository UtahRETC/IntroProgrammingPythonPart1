unit: 2
overview: "We're now ready to start coding, so we'll begin by introducing the basic components of programming: variables, values and operators. We'll also learn how to write to the screen and read user input."
---

Go over variables and why they're useful, numbers, strings, booleans, as well as operators that work on those types. There can be less of an emphasis on boolean operators since we'll review those when we go over [[Conditionals|conditionals]].

Introduce reading user input and printing to the screen since this will be used in the homework. Show how comments work and how to use them. Run all samples during class.

Possible homework is to write a program that accepts user input and performs some soft of calculation which is then printed to the screen. Try to incorporate casting. If casting is used in the homework, make sure to introduce it in class.

This will students will submit a coding assignment, so make sure to go over what is expected:
- A `.py` file should be submitted.
- A screenshot of the output should be submitted. The screenshot should clearly show all of the output.
- Code should run without modification.

```
A vacation is when you take a trip to some (adjective 1) place with your (adjective 2) family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an (noun 1) or up on a/an (noun 2). A good vacation place is one where you can ride (plural noun 1) or play (game 1) or go hunting for (noun 3). I like to spend my time (verb ending in "ing" 1) or (verb ending in "ing" 2).
```

## Mad Lib

As a way to introduce variables, user input, and output, we'll implement a Mad Lib game. We'll first implement the pseudocode and then write the Python code together in class.

## Continuation

We'll start by continuing where we left off last class and finish writing the code for the Mad Lib Python program.

- Converting strings to numbers
