title: Connect 4
---

In this assignment you will write a program to play Connect 4 against another
player. Connect 4 is a game where two players compete against each other and
try to connect four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first
player to do this wins the game. [This
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylZBRUJi3UQ) explains how this works.

There two players in Connect 4, one with red pieces and another with black
pieces. Your program should handle the input for both of these players and be
able to distinguish them. The game board has 6 rows and 7 columns, your program
should follow this as well. When a player places a winning piece, your program
should detect this and stop running. Your program should also detect when the
board is completely filled but no player won.

**The only design requirement in this assignment is to use at least two
functions. You can decide what the functions do.**
