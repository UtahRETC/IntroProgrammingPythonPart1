unit: 3
overview: "We'll be learning about conditionals which will allow us to write programs that perform different actions depending on a set of conditions that you specify. We'll take this as a chance to review boolean operations."
---

Start with a review of boolean logic and logic operators then move into conditionals (`if` statements, including `if`, `elif`, and `else`). We're diving more into the syntax of Python, so talk about whitespace sensitivity. Also talk about code blocks and how to identify if code "belongs" to an if statement.
