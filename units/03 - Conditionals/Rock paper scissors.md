title: Rock, Paper, Scissors
unit: 3
---

We will be creating a program that lets two players play rock, paper, scissors.
Your program will prompt the first player, player 1, to enter their movie
(either rock, paper, or scissors), and then prompt the second player, player 2,
to enter their move.

Using the rules of rock, paper, scissors, your program will determine and print
the results of the game. If it's a tie, your program should print "It's a tie".
If player 1 wins, prints "Player 1 wins". And if player 2 wins, print "Player 2
wins".

The rules of rock, paper, scissors are as follow:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.
- If both players choose the same move (eg. both choose rock), it's a tie.
