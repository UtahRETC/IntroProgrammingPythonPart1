title: Traffic light simulator
unit: 3

We will be creating a program that asks the user to enter the color of a traffic light (green, yellow, or red), then prints a message according to the color of the light.

If the user entered "green", your program should print "You may proceed with confidence".
If the user entered "yellow", your program should print "You may slowly proceed".
If the user entered "red", your program should print "Stop!".
If the user entered anything other than "green", or "yellow", or "red", your program should print "I don't know what to do".
