## ⭐ Coursera: From Nand to Tetris ⭐

<span class="centered narrow">

[From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), this is a two part course which starts by introducing logic gates (and, or, nand, etc.) that are used to built circuits (RAM, ROM, ALU, CPU) which come together into a fully working computer (you built a virtual computer).

</span>

---

## ⭐ Coursera: From Nand to Tetris ⭐

<span class="centered narrow">

The second part has you implement an assembler that compiles code into machine instructions that are executed by the CPU you built in the first part of the course, then moves on to building a high level programming language and compiler.

</span>

---

## ⭐ Coursera: From Nand to Tetris ⭐

<span class="centered narrow">

At the end of the course you would have built Tetris in your own programming language which runs in the virtual computer that you built.
