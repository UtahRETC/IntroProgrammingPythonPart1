Below are resources you can use to continue your path to learning programming and becoming a software engineer. All of these resources are free to use.

# Meetups

_Meetup is a social media platform for hosting and organizing in-person and virtual activities, gatherings, and events for people and communities of similar interests, hobbies, and professions._

Meetups are a great way to connect with other members of the programming community. Check out meetup.com to find near by and online groups that you're interested in. Here's a few Python groups and their upcoming meetings:

[The Tech Academy SLC Community](https://www.meetup.com/techacademyslc/), _This is a group for anyone interested in software development and web development. The Tech Academy is a code school located in Portland, OR and online at www.learncodinganywhere.com. Anyone is welcome! _
- December 21 at 2:30 PM MST: [Intro to Python](https://www.meetup.com/techacademyslc/events/290067843/)
- December 22 at 2:30 PM MST: [Intro to JavaScript & HTML](https://www.meetup.com/techacademyslc/events/290068297/)

[Redmond Python](https://www.meetup.com/redmond-python-user-group/), _This is a group for anyone who is interested in learning more about the Python programming language. Absolute beginners and seasoned experts are welcome!_
- December 15 at 7:30 PM MST (**today!!!**): [Command Line Fundamentals](https://www.meetup.com/redmond-python-user-group/events/290302690/), _Learning the basics of the command line is an important skill to have when developing with Python. Join this free workshop to learn the basics of the Bash shell which is commonly used on Linux/Mac and even on Windows with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL)._

[San Diego Python Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/), _Are you a Python or Django developer? Are you interested in meeting other developers? Join the San Diego Python Users Group meetup! All skill levels are welcome._

# Tutorials and walkthroughs

- **[12 Beginner Python Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg), 3 hour walkthrough of a programmer working on 12 different coding projects, like Minesweeper, a Sudoku solver, and a Tic-Tac-Toe AI.**
- **[Learn Flask for Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA), 45 minute tutorial of Flask. Flask is a web framework.**
- **[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkYVOmU3MgA), an introduction to data structures (eg, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.) and algorithms (eg, sorting, search, recursion, etc.) This course would be great to take for anyone interested in becoming a software engineer.**
- [Intermediate Python Programming Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo), 6 hour course going over basic concepts such as lists, strings, dictionaries, then moving on to more advanced topics such as threading, multiprocessing, generators, and more.
- [Pygame Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w), 2 hour tutorial of Pygame. Pygame is a game engine written in Python. You'll built a Space Invaders game in Pygame during this tutorial.
- [Learn Python by Building Five Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc), 7 hour walkthrough of a programmer building games in Python using a library called Pygame. The games include Pong, Tetris, an online multiplayer game, and more.
- [Object Oriented Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_02ICOIgs), 2 hour tutorial going over Object Oriented Programming concepts and implementation in Python.
- [Develop an AI to play Connect Four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8392NJjj8s0), 90 minute tutorial where you built a program that plays Connect 4.
- [Other tutorials in freeCodeCamp.org's YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp/search?query=python)

# Khan Academy

[Computers and the Internet](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet), introduction to low level computer topics such as binary numbers, logic gates, higher level topics such as networking, routing, web protocols, cyber security.

[Computer science](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science), course starts with an introduction to algorithms (searching, sorting, tree walking, etc.) and moves on to cryptography (encryption/decryption).

# Exercism

Exercism is a free to use online tool and community that offers programming/coding challenges. You're given a program to build, and once you're done you can submit your code and others will be able to review it and give you feedback.

They offer "tracks" for different programming languages. This is a great way to learn a new language or keep your skill sharp in a language you already know. Check out the [Python track](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/).

# Coursera

**[From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), this is a two part course which starts by introducing logic gates (and, or, nand, etc.) that are used to built circuits (RAM, ROM, ALU, CPU) which come together into a fully working computer (you built a virtual computer).**

**The second part has you implement an assembler that compiles code into machine instructions that are executed by the CPU you built in the first part of the course, then moves on to building a high level programming language and compiler.**

**At the end of the course you would have built Tetris in your own programming language which runs in the virtual computer that you built.**

[Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python), a five course program that starts with an introduction to programming in Python and ends with building web applications that use databases. Our class covered roughly the first two courses in this program and started getting into the third one.
