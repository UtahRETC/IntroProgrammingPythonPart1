# Overview

In this assignment, we will set up the programs that you are going to need in order to start programming in Python. Make sure to complete all of the items listed below in order.

# 1: Install Python

If you are on macOS (if you are on a Mac), then your computer already comes with Python installed and you can skip this section and move on to the next one.

If you are on Windows, head to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python by clicking on the “Download Python” button. Once the download is complete, run the install wizard and keep all of the default settings selected. If you are having issues, refer to this video for a walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwIXfaGEN4c.


# 2: Install Visual Studio Code

Head to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and click on the download button for your operating system.

If you are on Windows, once the download is complete, run the install wizard and keep all of the default settings selected. If you are having issues, refer to this video for a walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA.

If you are on macOS, once the download is complete, go to your Downloads folder and double click on the downloaded file. It's a zip file, so double clicking it will extract its contents. Once that's done, you should see a new file named “Visual Studio Code”. Move this file out of your Downloads folder and into your Applications folder. If you are having issues, refer to this video for a walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RoWZXcbPjw (the first two minutes are all you need)

From here on out, I'll refer to Visual Studio Code as VS Code since it's easier to say and write. This name is also widely used by other software engineers.

# 3: Run a Python script from Visual Studio Code

Now we're going to run a Python program using VS Code and ensure everything is working as expected. The sections below will walk you through how to create a new Python file (a program), install the Python extension on to VS Code so that we can run our Python programs from within VS Code, and finally run the program.

I encourage you to get in the habit of saving all of the code for this class in a folder you can easily access, so first create a folder inside of your Documents named “Introduction to Programming with Python Class” and save all future files related to this class in that folder.

## Install the Python extension for VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open the Extensions menu in VS Code by clicking on the “Extensions” button on the left side of the VS Code window. Refer to arrow “A” in the image below if you can't find the “Extensions” button.
3. Search for the Python extension by typing in “python” in the search field. Refer to arrow “B” in the image below.
4. Find the extension published by Microsoft. It should be the first one. Refer to arrow “C” in the image below.
5. Click on the “Install” button once you find the extension. Refer to arrow “D” in the image below.
6. Wait a few seconds for the install to complete.

## Create your Python program

1. Create a new file in VS Code (you can do this by clicking on the “File” menu and selecting “New Text File”).
2. Copy/paste (or better yet, type yourself) the following code into your new file: `print("Hello, World")`
3. Save the file and name it `hello_world.py` (you can do this by clicking on the “File” menu and selecting “Save”).

## Run your Python program

1. Click on the “Run” button located on the top right hand corner of the VS Code window. Refer to arrow “E” in the image below for a reference on where this button is.
2. A new panel should open and you should see your program's output. Make sure you see “Hello, World” like on the image below.
