## What is Python?

Python is a programming language.

---

## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a tool. It's like human language, but for communicating with computers.

birth_day = input("Enter your birth day: ")


def calculate_age_in_years(birthdate):
  today = date.today()

  return today.year - birthdate.year - ((today.month, today.day) <
          (birthdate.month, birthdate.day))


birthdate = date(int(birth_year), int(birth_month), int(birth_day))
print("You are " + str(calculate_age_in_years(birthdate)) + " years old")
```
