title: Pyramid
unit: 4
---

In this assignment you will write a program that uses two `while` loops to print a pyramid like this one:

\vspace{.2in}

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
########
```

\vspace{.2in}

Tips to get you started:

- You'll need to use two loops in this program, use the inner most one (the nested one) to print the rows.
- Try using one `while` loop that counts up when printing the rows separators (the new lines) and another that counts down when printing the rows.
- Use `print("#", end="")` to print `"#"` without a new line at the end. Use this when you want to print characters next to each other.
- Use `print("")` to print a new line. Use this when you want to start printing characters in the next line.
