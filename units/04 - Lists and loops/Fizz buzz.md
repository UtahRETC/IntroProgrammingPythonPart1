Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, but for numbers divisible by 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number, for numbers divisible by 5, print `"Buzz"` instead, and for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

This is the sample output of the program for the numbers from 1 to 20:
