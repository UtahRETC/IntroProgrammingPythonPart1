In this assignment you will update your Wordle programs to allow the player to make up to 6 attempts to guess the word correctly. Each time the player guesses the word incorrectly, you should give them hints (see the first Wordle assignment instructions for details on this).

When the player guesses the word correctly, print `"Congratulations, you guessed it right!"`. When the player runs out of guesses, print `"The word was [the word], better luck next time."`
