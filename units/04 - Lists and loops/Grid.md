title: Grid
unit: 4

In this assignment you will write a program that prints a 5 x 5 grid using two `while` loops. The result of your program should look like this:

\vspace{.2in}

```
x x x x x
x x x x x
x x x x x
x x x x x
x x x x x
```

\vspace{.2in}

Tips to get you started:

- Use `print("x", end="")` to print `"x"` without a new line at the end. Use this when you want to print characters next to each other.
- Use `print("")` to print a new line. Use this when you want to start printing characters in the next line.
